About this repository.

I was introducted to the Bering Sea Rule a handful of years ago.
I have generated an automated medium range weather forecast model for the United States based on the rule.
I have broken down the current model to a bare necessity engine.
I envision many improvements to this base engine. 
I anticipate collaboration with other enthusiasts of the BSR who also enjoy programming.
